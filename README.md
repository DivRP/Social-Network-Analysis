Use Amazon Product Co-purchase data to make Book Recommendations using Network Analysis

## About data:

1. Id: Product id (number 0, ..., 548551)

## Learning Objective and methodology:
1. Apply Python concepts to read and manipulate data and get it ready for analysis
2. Apply Network Analysis concepts to Build and Analyze Graphs
3. Apply concepts in Text Processing, Network Analysis and Recommendation Systems to make a product recommendation
4. Apply graph related measures such as Degree Centrality and Clustering Coefficient
5. Develop a composite measure/ logic for best result of recommendations
