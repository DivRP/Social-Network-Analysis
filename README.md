## Project Objective:
Use Amazon Product Co-purchase data to make Book Recommendations using Network Analysis

## About data:
This data set is comprised of product and review metadata on 548,552 different products. The data was collected in 2006 by crawling the Amazon website.The following information is available for each product in this dataset:
•	Id: Product id (number 0, ..., 548551)

## Learning Objective and methodology:
•	Apply Python concepts to read and manipulate data and get it ready for analysis
•	Apply Network Analysis concepts to Build and Analyze Graphs
•	Apply concepts in Text Processing, Network Analysis and Recommendation Systems to make a product recommendation
•	Apply graph related measures such as Degree Centrality and Clustering Coefficient
•	Develop a composite measure/ logic for best result of recommendations
